# portfolio
This repository serves as a central portfolio of my academic and personal projects in robotics, automation, data science, and AI. Each project is linked with a brief description, key technologies used, and outcomes. It provides a structured overview of my practical experience with tools like ROS2, MQTT, Python, C++, TensorFlow, and more.
