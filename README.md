## 🤖 Robotics & Automation Projects

### 1. Arduinobot-ROS_2-Robotic-arm-Simulation
_Simulation of a modular, ROS 2-based autonomous robot with real-world control architecture and launch stack._

- Built a differential drive robot in Gazebo using custom URDF/Xacro.
- Configured ros2_control with `controller_manager` and real-time joint state broadcasters.
- Debugged and resolved ROS 2 pluginlib and SystemInterface errors by tracing and rebuilding from source.
- Developed lifecycle-managed launch system with namespaced, parameterized multi-node configuration.
- Focused on mirroring real deployment behavior for testing modular robotics stacks.
